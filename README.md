# Hi, Im ***Joseph*** ‚òïÔ∏è
## About Me
Hey there! I'm a passionate software engineer with an aptitude for designing and building innovative solutions to combat modern challenges. My diverse background includes experience in finance as a mortgage loan officer, which has provided me with a unique perspective and deep understanding of cutting-edge tools that have a significant impact on both consumers and businesses.

As a representative of a historically underrepresented population in the tech industry, I am deeply passionate about promoting diversity and inclusion in the workforce. I firmly believe that diverse teams are the key to unlocking innovation and driving meaningful change. By embracing different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds, we can create a more equitable and inclusive tech community that empowers everyone to thrive.

As a software engineer, I pride myself on driving tangible results and collaborating with teams to achieve success. I thrive in taking on complex challenges and respond dynamically to tailor solutions that align with each team or client's specific goals.

In my free time I enjoy going on hikes with my dog friends, playing sports, and giving my baby nephews the attention they deserve.
